In this section, we present our E-MOS model evaluation and the
results of the model i.e chosen frequency settings, for all the initial applications we profiled.
One important thing to remember is, we have optimized the model to 
work on energy as the first class objective and so the frequency setting chooses
by E-MOS is more aligned towards energy efficiency with reasonable performance loss.
We present our results based on each application type and the chosen frequency setting. 
We try to reason out why E-MOS would have chosen that setting and show the energy efficiency gains
for each category. For all the graphs, both the energy efficiency and performance are normalized
and are relative to the ondemand governor findings.

\subsection{Compute intensive workloads}
Figure~\ref{fig:user-spec} shows the relative energy efficiency and speedup
for SPEC2006 benchmarks which are mainly compute intensive workloads. 
E-MOS chose a frequency setting of 1.8Ghz to 2.4Ghz for best energy efficiency
among the available scalable frequency set. The geometric mean for 2.4Ghz indicates  
upto 1.4x of energy efficiency with just 3\% performance loss. Provided 
E-MOS was optimized for energy savings, 3\% performance loss with such significant energy gains
is a good indication. You can still boost the application till turbo boost capability
but you will lose lot of energy gains and so did E-MOS not choose setting
above 2.4Ghz as the power factor effects more to energy than the lower execution time.
With lower frequency of 1.8Ghz, you gain upto 1.6Ghz energy efficiency with performance loss
of 15\%. You might want to go to lower frequency settings when energy is at-most important with situations like
low battery in mobile phones.

\subsection{Cache sensitive workloads}
Figure~\ref{fig:user-splash} shows the relative energy efficiency and speedup
for SPLASH2 benchmarks which have both compute and cache sensitive workloads. 
E-MOS chose a frequency setting of 1.8Ghz to 2.1Ghz for best energy efficiency
among the available scalable frequency set. This rationale makes sense
as you want to slightly reduce the core frequency when most of the instructions
are accessing cache and especially with the random workload we saw in our case study,
you want to spend too many CPU cycles at higher frequency wasting energy.
The geometric mean for 2.1Ghz indicates  
upto 1.5x of energy efficiency with just 4\% performance loss.
With one setting lower, for 1.8Ghz you can gain energy efficiency upto 1.62x and a 9\% performance loss.
We believe for cache workloads 2.1Ghz is good, as modern processors are equipped with
prefect hing and out of order execution mechanisms which hides the cache latency effectively and thus 
want to be executing at slightly higher frequency than 1.8Ghz.
This result was interesting as we expected E-MOS to still choose a lower setting, but we 
got around 1.5x energy efficiency with a higher setting.

\subsection{Memory intensive workloads}
Figure~\ref{fig:user-micro} shows the relative energy efficiency and speedup
for micro-benchmark suite MICRO-BENCH which are memory intensive workloads. 
E-MOS chose a frequency setting of 1.2Ghz to 1.8Ghz for best energy efficiency
among the available scalable frequency set. The geometric mean for 1.2Ghz indicates  
upto 2x of energy efficiency with  13\% performance loss. 
it is interesting to see that even with the frequency increase to 1.8Ghz, there is no significant 
increase in performance for these workloads. So, it is better to run these applications
at lower frequency with half the energy (2x energy efficient) what you need for ondemand power governor.
You would see performance increasing if you have capability to increase the DRAM frequency. However,
in that case, you have to get the energy estimates of the entire system, which includes core, uncore and DRAM.

Overall, E-MOS analytical model with user-space power governor provided a good scalable frequency setting for all three type of application
with better energy efficiency compared to ondemand power governor. The results backed 
our intuition that application-aware energy management is better and it makes
sense for OS to give onus to user-space to make more better policy decisions.
However, with more community support and integrating E-MOS type application-aware  models into 
existing power governors could lead to better energy management solutions in OS. It was a small step
from out project towards achieving this goal of energy efficient computing and with tools getting better
we can expect to see more energy efficient solutions in coming days.
