\section{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}

	Current Linux Operating Systems' power governors do not provide a fine-grained control and management over the energy utilized by the applications running on a computing system. Linux power governors can either be set to statically scale the CPU frequency or they provide limited user capability to define the energy requirements of an application. These power governors operate on a generic energy management policy, which is based on the assumption that reducing frequency of CPU (using DVFS) or putting the system to low-power state would reduce the system energy always, without having necessary information about the application. In this project, we plan to enhance the Linux OS to have better energy management policies/mechanisms by first analyzing the resource consumption (CPU, Memory, I/O) of the applications and then using this application information to make better energy decisions in the kernel. Our E-MOS aims to provide improved energy efficiency to applications by having a fine-grained control over the energy (battery) resource.
